# Fundamentals of Networking

## Overview  
This module introduces fullstack developers to essential networking concepts. It covers topics such as network fundamentals, protocols, troubleshooting, and securing communications. By the end, students will have practical knowledge of network layers, communication protocols, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, and basic network security.

## **Session 1: Introduction to Networks**

### Key Concepts:
- **Networks & Types**: LAN, WAN, IP Addressing (IPv4, IPv6)
- **OSI vs TCP/IP Models**: 7 layers vs 4 layers
- **Networking Tools**: `ping`, `traceroute`, `netstat`

### Exercises:
- Use `ping` to test connectivity
- Compare IPv4 and IPv6

## **Session 2: OSI Model and the Transport Layer**

### Key Concepts:
- **OSI Layers**: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, etc.
- **TCP vs UDP**: Connection-oriented vs connectionless protocols
- **TCP Handshake**: 3-step process for establishing reliable connections

### Exercises:
- Implement a basic TCP server-client connection using Python

---

## **Session 3: DNS and Networking in Web Development**

### Key Concepts:
- **DNS**: Domain Name System, A Records, CNAME Records, MX Records
- **How DNS Works**: Root DNS Servers, TLD Servers, Authoritative DNS

### Exercises:
- Use `nslookup` to find the IP address of a domain
- Inspect DNS records with `dig`

## **Session 4: HTTP/HTTPS and APIs**

### Key Concepts:
- **HTTP**: Methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`), Status Codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx)
- **HTTPS & SSL/TLS**: Secure communication, Encryption Handshake

### Exercises:
- Use Postman to test API requests
- Use `curl` to send a `POST` request to a public API

## **Session 5: Networking Security Basics**

### Key Concepts:
- **Encryption**: Symmetric and Asymmetric
- **Firewalls**: Network vs Application Firewalls
- **Network Vulnerabilities**: DDoS, Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

### Exercises:
- Configure a basic firewall rule with `ufw`
- Implement SSL/TLS on a web application

## **Session 6: Advanced Networking Tools**

### Key Concepts:
- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analysis
- **Nmap**: Network scanning and security assessments
- **Netcat**: Versatile network tool

### Exercises:
- Capture local network traffic with Wireshark
- Use Nmap to scan for active hosts

## **Session 7: Rapid Project - Building a Secure and Scalable Application** 

### Key Concepts
1. **Network Infrastructure**: Implement load balancing and network segmentation.
2. **Security**: Set up HTTPS for secure communication.
3. **REST API**: Develop a REST API that supports HTTP methods and status codes.
