# Aula 3 - Exercicio 1

## Description

This exercise consists of a simple Python socket server and a BusyBox client, orchestrated using Docker Compose. The server listens for incoming connections, authenticates clients with a password, and echoes back any messages sent by authenticated clients. The BusyBox client is used to connect to the server using Telnet.

## Files

### [server.py](#file:server.py-context)

This Python script sets up a socket server that:
- Listens on `0.0.0.0:8080`.
- Accepts incoming connections.
- Authenticates clients with a password ("GiveMeADecentGrade").
- Echoes back any messages sent by authenticated clients.
- Closes the connection after a period of inactivity (30 seconds + 2 seconds to account sleep function).

### [docker-compose.yml](#file:compose.yml-context)

This Docker Compose file defines two containers:
- `python_server`: Runs the Python socket server.
- `busybox_client`: Runs a BusyBox container for testing the server.

## Tutorial

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Start the services using Docker Compose:**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Access the BusyBox client container:**
   ```sh
   docker exec -it exercicio1-busybox_client-1 sh
   ```

3. **Connect to the Python server using Telnet:**
   ```sh
   telnet exercicio1-python_server-1 8080
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts to authenticate and interact with the server.**

## Notes

- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
- The default password for authentication is "GiveMeADecentGrade".
- The server will close the connection after 32 seconds of inactivity.

Enjoy experimenting with the socket server and client setup!
